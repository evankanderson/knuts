Knative utilities for install and management (i.e. one-time setup and operator
concerns, rather than ongoing development tools).

## WARNING

This is totally work in progress, and right now does nothing. I'll be adding
commands and utilities in (possibly) the following order:

1. Install [build templates](https://github.com/knative/build-templates)
2. Create [docker](https://github.com/knative/build-templates/tree/master/gcr_helper) & github secrets for build templates
3. [Install Knative](https://github.com/knative/docs/tree/master/install)
4. Help find & install [eventing Sources](https://github.com/knative/eventing-sources)
5. Upgrade
